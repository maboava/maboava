- 👋 Hello world! I’m @maboava
- 👀 I’m interested in learning about new technologies and how I can use them to solve problems and provide innovative solutions.
- 🌱 Currently, I'm improving my skills in various programming languages, such as Ruby on Rails, JavaScript, Node.js, Assembly, PHP, Python, and SQL Server.
- 💞️ I'm eager to collaborate with others who are also learning or already have experience in any of the languages I master. I want to be inspired by the community's contributions and share my own knowledge.
- 📫 You can reach me at matheusboava12@gmail.com. I'm always open to new learning and collaboration opportunities!
