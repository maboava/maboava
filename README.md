- 👋 Hello world! I’m @maboava
- 👀 I’m interested in learn about new technologies and learn to use them to help solve problems and present solutions.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Ruby on Rails, JS, Node JS, Assembly, PHP, Python and SQL Server.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on with those who are learning something I have already programmed and be inspired by my contributions.
- 📫 You can reach me at matheusboava12@gmail.com.
